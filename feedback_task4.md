## General

Your code and files are structured and readable. You could be more consistent with the naming (lowercase, uppercase, dashes, definately no spaces).

The ignore file need to be named .gitignore 

## Design

I think the background image pulls a lot of attention, since it is very visible. You might try to soften it a bit.
